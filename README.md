# Discord Bot Mark 1

## Introduction

This is a Discord bot built with my needs and my friend groups in mind. Initially, we intended to have a simple bot to pick a game for us to play, which ironically I cannot do at the moment. However, learning JavaScript and Node.js does allow me to complete this goal.

We might implement features as we go in the future, but this bot might not be very useful or structured for most people to consider it as such

## Features

- Add games to the list
- Remove games from the list
- Pick a game randomly from the list
- Fetch memes from [Meme API](https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api)

## Installation

To run the server locally:

Clone the repository.
Ensure you have Node.js installed.
Run "npm install" to download the Discord module created by the official Discord team.
Obtain a Discord bot API Key from the official developer website.
Pass the API key either directly to the script or use modules like dotenv for this purpose.
Once you've completed these steps, the bot should have the basic functionality listed above.
