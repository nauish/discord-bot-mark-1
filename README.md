# Discord Bot Mark 1

## Introduction

This is a Discord bot that listens for user commands and send back replies. We always had troubles finding games to play, which ironically I cannot do at the moment. However, learning JavaScript and Node.JS does allow me to build the bot to prepare for the future.

This bot is by no mean useful for most people, and most of features are pretty niche or non-productive. If you are interested in building a bot you might use this as a template to build your own, and I highly encourage watching discord official documentation for their API.

## Features

- Add games to the list
- Remove games from the list
- Pick a game randomly from the list
- Pick random item from an assortment of JSONs.
- Fetch random stuff with [Meme API](https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api) and [Evil Insult Generator API](https://github.com/EvilInsultGenerator/website)

## Installation

To run the server locally:

Clone the repository.
Ensure you have Node.js installed.
Run "npm install" to download the Discord module created by the official Discord team.
Obtain a Discord bot API Key from the official developer website.
Pass the API key either directly to the script or use modules like dotenv for this purpose.
Once you've completed these steps, the bot should have the basic functionality listed above.
