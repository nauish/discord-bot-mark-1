# Discord Bot Mark 1

## Introduction

This is a Discord bot built with my need and my friend groups in mind. We initially intend to have a simple bot to pick a game for us to play, which ironically I cannot do at the moment. However, learning JavaScript and Node.JS do allow me to complete this goal.

We might implement feature as we go in the future, but this bot might not be very useful or structured for most people to consider it useful.

## Features

- Add games to the list
- Remove games from the list
- Randomly pick a game from the list
- Fetch memes from Meme API

## Installation

To run the server locally, you need to clone the repo, have Node.js installed and run "npm install" to download Discord module made by the official Discord team. You also need to have a Discord bot API Key which can be obtained on the official developer website. Once you passed in the API key either directly to script or use modules like dotenv. The bot should have basic functionality listed above.
